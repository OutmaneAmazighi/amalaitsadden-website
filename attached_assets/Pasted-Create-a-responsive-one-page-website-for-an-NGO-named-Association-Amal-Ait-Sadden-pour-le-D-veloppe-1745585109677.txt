Create a responsive one-page website for an NGO named "Association Amal Ait Sadden pour le D√©veloppement Durable".

üí° Key Requirements:
Languages: Arabic, French, German, English (simple language switcher in header)

Design: Clean, minimal, modern look that subtly reflects Amazigh culture (through colors, patterns, or typography)

Color Theme: Base the website‚Äôs main colors on the provided logo (placeholder colors for now; real logo will be uploaded later)

Structure: One single scrollable page with anchor navigation

üìå Sections:
Header

NGO name + logo

Simple language selector (ar/fr/de/en)

√úber uns

Short intro text about the association (placeholder, multilanguage-ready)

Aktivit√§ten (Merged with Galerie)

A vertical scrollable section showing each activity in reverse chronological order

Each activity should include:

Year

Name of activity

Location

One main photo

Short text description

And below that: a collapsible gallery or lightbox that shows additional photos for that activity when expanded

üí≠ Merging "Galerie" and "Aktivit√§ten" is an intentional design choice. Instead of having two separate sections, each activity includes a visual gallery of that event, all embedded in one structured flow.

Team

Show members in a card layout with:

Photo

Name

Role

Footer

Contact placeholders (email, location, etc.)

Note: ‚ÄúWebsite developed by Othman Hassani‚Äù

üîß Technical Specs:
Use vanilla HTML, CSS, JS (optionally TailwindCSS for faster design, if preferred)

Mobile and desktop responsive layout

One-page smooth scrolling with anchor links (e.g., clicking "Team" scrolls down to that section)

Use placeholder text and images for now

Code should be modular and well structured (e.g., index.html, style.css, script.js)

üß© Optional Enhancements:
Scroll-triggered animations (e.g., fade-in effects as activities appear)

Lightbox functionality for photo previews

Responsive grid or slider for the team section

üöÄ All visual and content placeholders will be updated later with real content, logo, and photos.
